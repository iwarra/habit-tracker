Priority:
"Arrow slide" in Calender to see next/previous week :
* Fix 'arrow slide' so it understands monthly changes / changeWeek function
* Change text to week number? 



* Click a date and get all habits for the day

* "See more"-page design and logic:
   - should a user be able to edit and delete habits here
   - should it display only the habits for that day

* Add button in the footer:
   - what exactly does a user need to be able to add/choose when adding a new habit
   - design ideas
