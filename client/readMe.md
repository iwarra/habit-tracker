Remaining in Calendar:
- Extract calendar styling to be reusable in other views ?

Prio:
*** When clicking on a day new page loads and the calendar reloads to current week!
*** If we click on a different day switch focus on the element instead of today?
*** Habit card in date: check not showing
*** Click area in calendar should be bigger (to open date page)?
*** URL for date page should be shortened ?


Add habit page:
   - responsiveness like hover etc
   - addNew cta hover style solution

Overview: 
   - Calendar dates wrap (set min-width?)
   - Habits sorting once they are checked

SASS:
   - add placeholder container that can be extended in all components to have universal styling
   - variables SASS file to separate all of the variables
