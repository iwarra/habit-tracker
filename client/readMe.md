To do:

- Change calendar "title"
- Fix filtering for date pages to only show habits relevant for that day
- Click area in calendar should be bigger (to open date page)?
- Selected options are not marked (makes it unclear if selected) when adding new habits
- Buttons to go back and forth, up and down on and between pages
- Calendar dates wrap (set min-width?)

SASS:

- add placeholder container that can be extended in all components to have universal styling
- variables SASS file to separate all of the variables
