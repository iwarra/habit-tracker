* Limit the number of habits displayed in overview:
   - In mobile view
   - In desktop (set max-width for the whole page)

* Click a date and get all habits for the day

* If check completed, change state of habit

* "See more"-page design and logic:
   - should a user be able to edit and delete habits here
   - should it display only the habits for that day

* Add button in the footer:
   - what exactly does a user need to be able to add/choose when adding a new habit
   - design ideas
