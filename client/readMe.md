* Add habit page:
   - input validation (add event on enter?)
   - delete input text after adding
   - responsivness like hover etc
   - footer styling


Remaining in Calendar:
* Click a date and get all habits for the day

* "See more"-page design and logic:
   - should a user be able to edit and delete habits here
   - should it display only the habits for that day
