**Routes and new components**
* Add habit page:
   - switch + to back button when the AddNew page is open
   - data storing
   - Category modal design and functionality 
   - what exactly does a user need to be able to add/choose when adding a new habit or a new category


Remaining in Calendar:
* Click a date and get all habits for the day

* "See more"-page design and logic:
   - should a user be able to edit and delete habits here
   - should it display only the habits for that day
