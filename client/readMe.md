* unresolved (Add habit page):
   - Footer icons size diff (svg issue?)
   - Calendar dates wrap (set min-width?)
   - responsiveness like hover etc
   - addNew cta hover style solution

Main logic tasks: 
   - expand the useHabits hook with additional logic


Remaining in Calendar:
* Click a date and get all habits for the day

* "See more"-page design and logic:
   - should a user be able to edit and delete habits here
   - should it display only the habits for that day



* Had in package.json
"vite-plugin-mkcert": "^1.10.1",
